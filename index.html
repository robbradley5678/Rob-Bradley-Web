            <p>Hopwood Motorsport is a garage specialising in selling and installing performance parts for BMW cars. The owner wanted to promote his workshop services, as well as sell products online.</p>
            <p><b>Built with: </b>WordPress, WooCommerce, Divi page builder</p>
            <p><b>Why WordPress? </b>To allow the owner to easily add and edit content and products once the site is live.</p>
            <p><b>Notes: </b>Although the Divi page builder was used, the design is from a blank sheet - no templates used here! There are also bits of custom CSS added here and there to overcome some of Divi's styling limitations.</p>
            <p>
              <b>To do:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Compile CSV file of all products and variations, upload to WooCommerce</li>
                <li>Define product categories and sub-categories, relaated products</li>
                <li>Design store page, with easy navigation to categories and products</li>
                <li>Design basket, checkout, order confirmation pages, customer emails</li>
                <li>Implement Stripe plugin</li>

            <p>The owners of The Squirrel Tea Room used to run a mobile coffee van at Forby Woods. They've now moved to a brick-and-mortar cafe in Ainsdale. They wanted a brochure website to:

                <li>Reflect the interior design of the cafe</li>

                <li>List the menu</li>
                <li>Showcase local artists who display work in the cafe</li>

            <p>This is one of my personal projects. The ES-333 is a popular guitar made by Gibson. It was discontinued years ago, and no information appears on their official website anymore. I wanted to collate and summarise all the information online into a single source, with a section for users to leave comments.</p>
            <p><b>Built with: </b>WordPress, Divi page builder</p>
            <p><b>Why WordPress? </b>This was my first foray into Wordpress. After becoming frustrated with various free themes and the Gutenburg editor, I wanted to try a WYSIWYG page builder that offered a lot of custimization. Divi's pricing was affordable, it has lots of built in features to minimize the need for plugins, and there is lots of help and tutorials online. </p>
            <p><b>What do I think? </b>It's a lot quicker than coding from scratch! There is a lot of bloat in the code output, but properly optimized, it seems to return good page speed scores. </p>
